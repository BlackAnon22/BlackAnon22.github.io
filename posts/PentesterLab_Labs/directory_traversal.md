So, our task is to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability and get the key that solves the lab

Navigate to the webpage,

Our first task will be to identify the path for directory traversal.

Checking the page source,

Lets try to access that image

Well, to test for directory traversal, we can start out by trying to view the content ```/etc/passwd```, so we can start with the filepath ```../../../../../../etc/passwd```

Nice, we were able to read the ```/etc/passwd``` file.

Now, lets retrieve the key from file path ```/pentesterlab.key```. So, we'll have something like this ```../../../../../../pentesterlab.key```

submitting the key,

We have succesfully completed this labðŸ˜Ž

So, our task is to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability and get the key that solves the lab

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/8dc63578-018f-4dbb-9af9-5cb46d4549e4)

Checking the source page,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/e8e8d328-761b-427f-8a49-af894a86fa4d)

Lets try to view the image

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/3403ec32-cad5-4d3b-b536-b9005ae7230d)

This application transmits the full file path via a request parameter, and validates that the supplied path starts with the expected folder. So to solve this weâ€™ll include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences

So, to view the content of the ```/etc/passwd``` file, weâ€™ll have something like this ```/var/www/../../../../../../etc/passwd```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/81a629f7-1449-48e5-80a1-8eef3c9c3ee0)

cool stuff, we were able to view the content of the ```/etc/passwd``` file, now lets read the content of the file ```/pentesterlab.key```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/b4894af0-0368-4b30-a377-b27fe842514e)

Click on that path to view it's content

Now, lets try to read the ```/etc/passwd``` file, to do that we'll be using ```NULL BYTE``` to get rid of any suffix added by the server-side code.

So, we'll have something like this ```../../../etc/passwd%00```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/09d414d2-447d-4134-ba7e-1ed521997a18)

cool it worked. Lets go ahead and get the key that solves this lab for us.

To get the key ```../../../pentesterlab.key%00```
