Our task is to get the stored key in the admin's account

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/521b38ec-b98c-4d95-87e1-09114c4dba34)

Lets create an account

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/b8c9ea5d-eee8-47f0-b956-c0934fb62ef3)

Lets create a secret

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/cb24b179-b509-426b-9dc3-845c440fe779)

Now, lets fire up burpsuite, we'll capture this request and send it over to burp repeater

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/13fd0ee4-298b-473d-b4bd-725be51c302a)

What happens when we change the ```2``` to ```3```??? Well, lets find out

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/928b04c3-813e-46a5-8a92-317343b9a1da)

Alright, so that's the secret I created.

How about we change it to ```1```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/89eeef8b-c9b2-4e83-9d6e-219ea7764371)

We got the key,

Our task is to get the stored key located in the admin user's account

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/877995e2-6a49-49dd-92ff-bd7fb48d2e78)

So, we'll signup and try to create a new secret

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/5109d1d8-d595-487a-bf16-bd110ed66049)

Now, we'll capture this request using burpsuite and send it over to burp repeater

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/1a677c46-1efb-4e7e-9667-5c6578059a83)

Changing the number doesn't work as it did in the previous lab.

Take a loot at the jwt token been used

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/4f81fb2e-5341-47dc-8668-ede8a87f7593)

We can check the contents of this token using an online tool, you can access it [here](https://jwt.io/)

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/aa634a08-285f-4491-b840-14cfac67c998)

Lets change the ```id``` to ```1```. Then we copy the new token that'll be generated and replace it with the former one on burpsuite

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/69bedab0-cef5-4393-8001-d78ad9214ab0)

So we got an error, that says the secret is not owned by the user. Lets change ```/api/secrets/2``` to ```/api/secrets/1``` since we are trying to view the admin's secret

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/80ab840f-0c33-4e9a-ba3f-cffd75cfa479)

We got the ket hehe

Our task is to get the key that solves this lab and this key is located in the admin user's account

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/91a76546-d49d-457f-81d2-864b0614f5fe)

Lets create and account, then we try to create a new secret

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/5ecafb3c-41a2-45c0-bf49-bee72045257a)

Now, lets capture this request using burpsuite and send it over to burp repeater

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/8c883f09-f040-45f6-a231-9ff9fb13bcaa)

This lab is similar to the previous lab, just that in this lab we have to get the secret key before we can edit the content of the token

We'll be using a tool called ```hashcat``` to try to get the secret. 

command:```hashcat -m 16500 -a 0 jwt_token.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/dd9b2968-1239-4c54-9fa1-3b29e37841ba)

cool, we got the secret to be ```secret```, now lets edit the token with the online website we used earlier

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/1635e48c-d48e-45cd-af17-651e23da3927)

As you can see, from the above screenshot, I changed the ```id``` to ```1``` and also provided the secret phrase. 

Now lets copy that token and replace it with the former one

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/13049948-7e66-432e-95fb-d2967f2f1bc3)

Changing ```/api/secrets/2``` to ```/api/secrets/1``` should get us the key

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/1adcf6bd-c2dd-4319-9220-c07d837c2121)

Well, that's an endpoint. Lets analayze what's here. To do this, navigate to the webpage and capture the request using burpsuite

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/febc1518-91ac-48c6-be5f-236726bfdfc1)

We'll be using a ```POST``` request for this

Lets analyze the endpoing ```/get_more_secret```

Navigate to the webpage, capture the request using burpsuite and send it over to burp repeater. Also, change the request method to ```POST```

Our task is to review the responses from the different API endpoints, to find an information leak allowing you to get logged in as ```admin@libcurl.so``` and get the key for this challeng

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/d83b7020-8b8a-46e6-a6d7-7b154af39356)

We have a login page, lets try to register an account

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/bdd94df9-ed97-4300-a975-87b25fdf038e)

So we have to be logged in with the admin's email address

Checking the login page, you'll see there's a reset email function. Since we don't know the password of the admin email address lets reset the password

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/5bd3fc9f-68dd-4c7e-b678-e5c77f1cef70)

We don't have access to check the mail lool. Lets try to reset again but this time we'll capture the request on burpsuite and send it over to burp repeater

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/e44425ef-4255-4100-9af8-6a606fdced04)

You can see we got the url for the password reset.

Navigate to that url

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/1e487188-896d-4444-87c8-bd42b3cb0e72)

Lets provide a password to reset the account

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/100aaaba-29ae-4a46-a51f-cb7084742016)

Now lets login with the password we used to reset

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/ade5d7f9-8f76-489b-b6cd-459da472eb68)
