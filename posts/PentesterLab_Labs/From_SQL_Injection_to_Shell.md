Navigate to the webpage,

Click on "pool", you should get this url

Checking if it is vulnerable to SQLi, just add ```'``` at the back of ```3```. This should trigger a SQL error

We'll be exploiting this from the webpage

Lets check for the number of columns available in the database. We can use the query
```sql
order by 1 -- 
order by 2 --
order by 3 --
```
Using these queries

This means we don't have a 5th column in the database, which means we have just 4 columns.

Lets check for the column that is compatible with string data, that is the vulnerable column. We can use the query
```sql
AND 0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4-- -
```
This query should return the vulnerable column

We can see that column 2 is the vulnerable one. 

Lets check the version the database is using
```sql
UNION SELECT 1,version(),3,4-- -
```

Checking for the name of the database, we can use the query
```sql
UNION SELECT 1,database(),3,4-- -
```

We got the name of the database to be ```photoblog```

Checking for the "tablename", we can use the query
```sql
UNION SELECT 1,database(),3,4-- -
```
