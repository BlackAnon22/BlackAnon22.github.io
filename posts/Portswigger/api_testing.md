# Lab: Exploiting an API endpoint using documentation
<hr>

## Task

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e638172-96ca-41b8-a510-1f8f5f42653c)

So we are find an exposed API documentation

First, lets navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b3450b0-e562-4712-845d-2d6b6101d2f4)

Logging in with the creds we were given

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df7b3b24-95fd-4c9d-a8ff-94e9e60abfd8)

We are logged in, lets head back to the "Home" page

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0000145-db66-4681-b91f-ec94c2f90f61)

Lets perform directory fuzzing using dirsearch

command:```dirsearch -u https://0a0c004c037a9ea281dd253c00720078.web-security-academy.net/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8e8c8ae-96f8-4a62-8d5f-592ae92c3ba1)

We have the `/api` directory

Navigating to the directory you should see this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5bd4cdc-48e6-4f58-a8a1-cb23e92ac318)

We can that to complete the task which is to delete the user `carlos` since we've gotten the endpoint to use from the documentation.

I sent the request to burp repeater,

Refreshing the webpage

# Lab: Finding and exploiting an unused API endpoint
<hr>

## Task

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca64c13b-05f6-4605-a73d-76cab59e8e2a)

The task is to buy a `Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket` by exploiting a hidden api endpoint

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d221d66-5ab1-48dc-880c-3d33c6900167)

Since we have login creds, lets login

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbe73353-9fd7-4597-acaa-b42cd83dbf22)

Running a directory enumeration scan didn't show any api directory

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d3e5887-23da-4236-926c-4f891510394b)

I did a bit of crawling with burpsuite and I got this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a53e5ef-c629-43c4-8ec2-81d1769b0326)

Send the request to repeater,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f166ca9-3649-4705-a934-f64c57bddb22)

Lets try to change the HTTP method from `GET` to say `PATCH`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a10a8bb-438d-47ec-9154-3f9cdf69a253)

We got an unauthorized error, what I did was go to the browser, login with the creds I was given then captured a fresh request

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e6166cc-6eb3-4268-a5a0-6ef140d81257)

From the error message we can see that our `content-type` is meant to be `application/json`. 

To change the content-type to application/json I used the BApp extension `content type converter`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0431829e-a6a7-45e3-97bd-edcb3ddb979b)

Now lets add the parameter

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b2d0ae3-ce72-463a-a87d-680f42ead657)

We've successfully updated the price

Now we can add the leather jacket to our cart,

# Lab: Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability
<hr>

## Task

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd4a52d-365a-41df-af92-b6efb5f551e7)

So the task is to exploit the mass assignment vulnerability

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b9344e5-6a86-4720-8f4d-386e91cbb881)

Login with the given credentials

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f760ccbb-a371-4123-8844-ccbffaab9557)

Lets do a bit of directory fuzzing using dirsearch

command:```dirsearch -u https://0ac30071046b997e82cb8d7300fd0059.web-security-academy.net/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff6e4ce9-8efa-4d7c-b0a2-eec60d01e64c)

Navigating to the `/api` directory

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea00fe7e-b57c-486b-a05a-5c591f49cd07)

We found an endpoint `/checkout`

First, lets add the leather jacket to our cart, then we'll capture a fresh request and navigate to the `/checkout` endpoint

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e09e571-f064-44b1-8fcd-1482a6861332)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/840cde0a-0a89-4a3e-bcb2-3142b1936e1f)

```json
{"chosen_discount":{"percentage":0},"chosen_products":[{"product_id":"1","name":"Lightweight \"l33t\" Leather Jacket","quantity":1,"item_price":133700}]}
```
From the json output above we have the "chosen_discount" parameter, this means we can specify the percentage discount that applies to the product. As at this point the percentage discount is 0%, this means the price of the leather jacket is still `133700`.

Now we'll change the `content-type` of our request to `application/json`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75021da1-1bbd-4496-9e64-6bef1f2722b8)

Next thing to do is to add the json output we got from our `GET` request

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7538856c-a16e-4195-a9f4-9f99f32a2ae5)

We set the percntage discount to "100" which means we can get the Leather Jacket for free

Checking the webpage

# Lab: Exploiting server-side parameter pollution in a query string
<hr>

## Task

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09bbe349-e5f0-485e-8d38-f360728897da)

The task is to login as the adminsitrator and delete the user "carlos"

Navigate to the webpage,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/223f9721-7258-46e8-8adb-49778884efd8)

Lets do a bit of directory fuzzing using dirsearch

command:```dirsearch -u https://0a51000f039fe20b81de9d3700ec00a6.web-security-academy.net/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24bced5c-45d7-448f-aa02-dd97469267d2)

We have a `/forgot-password` directory

Navigating to that directory,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4aec894-0e38-4054-adf8-87798312c7b6)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77bc690f-b673-47b8-857a-1301b872cf9a)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b0e98a9-ceff-4d67-a06c-f7d37cbd0120)

Lets attempt to add another parameter `foo` with a value `bankai`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01ff45ce-676a-40c2-95ec-779394a2866c)

We got a "parameter not supported" error, this means the the internal API may have interpreted our parameter `&foo=banaki` as a separate parameter.

Lets try to truncate the query string by using the character `#` (ensure it is url encoded)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39fbdd4f-e13a-4a7c-a948-15b82a8e0e76)

We got a "field not specified" error which indicates that there's a field parameter. We'll use the parameter `field` and the value `bankai`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675d5ac6-1d1e-48c0-9877-6677d1ec0214)

We still get the "invalid username", lets change the username from "BlackAnon" to "administrator" since "administrator" is a valid username

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e8a48af-70bd-425c-9c3d-fe3dbfa16d2a)

"Invalid field" error message, this means the server-side application may recognize the injected field parameter

How do we get the correct value for the field parameter?? 

We'll bruteforce hell out of itðŸ’€

Send the request to burp intruder

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d699ba69-273c-457f-a85a-ed2f597c4ec0)

You can get the server-side variable names [here](https://github.com/antichown/burp-payloads/blob/master/Server-side%20variable%20names.pay)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a86c5f3-b65a-4d59-9f64-33e8991d4ba8)

Start the attack,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41382d11-4017-436d-acc0-c37460b8cfc0)

From the screenshot above we can see that the payload "email" and "username" are valid values for the `field` parameter because they return the `200` status code

Lets resend the request, this time we'll be using `email` as our value for the `field` parameter

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/207a0c70-72d5-4af8-861c-9e62a6d198f9)

This returned the original output.

What next??

Earlier when I crawled the webpage using burpsuite I found this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa4324c3-dc1d-4f38-8af7-6682be2e0dec)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/610e3471-d034-4572-ae3b-07076d91704b)

Lets check if `reset-token` is a valid value for the `field` parameter
