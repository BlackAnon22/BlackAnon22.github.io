So, there's an unprotected admin panel, so to solve this lab we have to delete the user ```carlos```.

Alright, whenever I am checking out a webpage one of the directories I check before trying anything else is ```robots.txt```. The directory at times may contain some juicy details hehe

Navigating to the ```/robots.txt``` directory you should see this
