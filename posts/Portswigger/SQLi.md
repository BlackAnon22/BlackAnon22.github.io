Now, lets capture this request on burpsuite

To display one or more unreleased products, we can use the payload ```' or 1=1--```, make sure this is url encoded to something like this ```'+or+1%3d1--```.

Adding this payload to the url,

So we are asked to login as the ```administrator``` user, to do this we can use this

username:```administrator'--```          password:```aaaaaaa```

Note: We can either provide a blank password or we use any random stuff for the password since the password will get commented out anyways

# SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

Capturing the request on burpsuite,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/6974648d-151b-4b1d-a68e-1aad9dbcf6b6)

First thing to do is to confirm the number of columns available in the database

So, we'll be using the query
```
' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--
```
Ensure this is url encoded, so when you get the internal server error, it means the column number isn't available

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/46cca6a6-9af2-41e9-a473-8f2388847fce)

This means there's a column available in the database,

Trying other queries

This makes it 2 columns available in the database,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/28d25efa-ca02-4434-93ae-a908703068d9)

From the above screenshot you'll see that the query ```' order by 3--``` returned an Internal Server Error, which means there isn't a column 3 available in the database.

So, we have 2 columns available in the database.

To query the database version we can use the following query 
```
' UNION SELECT banner,null FROM v$version--
```
Explaining this
```
The banner column contains the information about the database version
The null is just there to fill in for the second column of the result
v$version is the name of a database table
```
Trying the query
