I participated in the LACTF competition with my friend Sensei and I was able to solve 5 challs. Yeah, welcome challs and discord challs inclusive, that's my specialty afterallðŸ˜‚. I wasn't available throughout the CTF though, this was because of exams hehe.

Lets take a look at the challs I solved

You can get this flag when you navigate to their discord server and then check the pinned message in `#general`

We get this google form, now when you try to fill this form you'll notice it's in a loop

As you can see it is more of an infinite loop thing.

Lets capture this request on burpsuite and see what happens
