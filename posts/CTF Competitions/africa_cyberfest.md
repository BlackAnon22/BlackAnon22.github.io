I participated in the LACTF competition with my friend Sensei and I was able to solve 5 challs. Yeah, welcome challs and discord challs inclusive, that's my specialty afterallðŸ˜‚. I wasn't available throughout the CTF though, this was because of exams hehe.

Lets take a look at the challs I solved

There's a landing page which is the url where the challs are hosted on, this [url](https://afr1cacyb3rfe5t.ctfd.io).

Checking the page source should fetch you the flag

## Say Hello

The question asked here was "Are you following these twitter accounts??", since I already follow all of them before now my response is "yes"

FLAG:-```yes```

-----------------------------------

## Do you read 2

Yeah, you can already see the flag thereðŸ˜…

FLAG:-```actf{i_did_not_skip_this_cutscene}```

Lets connect to the challenge instance

You can see from the above screenshot that we can't use the normal linux commands here. 

To solve this chall we'll make use of wildcards

```
Wildcards are characters used in shell commands to represent one or more other characters. They're commonly used in file management commands to specify patterns of filenames that you want to match. Here are some common wildcards:

* (asterisk): Matches any sequence of characters, including none.
? (question mark): Matches any single character.
[ ] (square brackets): Matches any one character within the specified range or set.
Here's how they work in practice:

*: Matches zero or more characters.
Example: *.txt matches any file ending in .txt.
?: Matches exactly one character.
Example: file?.txt matches file1.txt, fileA.txt, but not file12.txt.
[ ]: Matches any one character within the specified range or set.
Example: [123].txt matches 1.txt, 2.txt, or 3.txt.
```
Lets try to cause an error

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/b14923cc-88b0-4e88-99c4-d594e2380340)

You can see that theere's a bash script in that directory but then we don't know the directory we are sitted at

To try to read a file in this directory we can try using the wildcards we can just use the wildcard ```. ????``` where ```??? represents the length of the file we want to read``` and ```. when used as a standalone character refers to the current working directory

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/42fcf6c7-97fc-46c6-b4ae-4005264b2a82)

We were able to read the ```lol.txt``` file

Lets make an assumption here, we'll assume that the flag is in the ```flag.txt``` file, so to read this we can use the wildcard ```. ????????```

We got our flag

FLAG:-```ACTF{Th4t_w4s_5impl3_wasnt_it?}```

# Web

Navigate to the webpage

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/34409e37-1c2e-49ae-ab65-c3ee87d72e6c)

You see it's blank, viewing the page source

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/53c028ef-b714-49ac-969e-a43069a389d7)

Also blank

Lets fuzz for directories using ffuf

command:```ffuf -u "https://afr1cacyb3rfe5t-troll.chals.io/FUZZ" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt  -e .zip,.sql,.php,.phtml,.bak,.backup```

We have the ```/robots.txt``` directory, checking this directory

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/21fc78dc-5ab7-4ddd-a3ae-84e87daaa7f1)

We have another directory here, lets navigate to this directory

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/38c71c85-a0ab-4662-8d87-632f94e92243)

So navigating to that directory gives us a file to download

```

```
oops, that's a binary.

Using the command ```strings robots.txt | grep "actf{"``` or the command ```strings robots.txt | grep "ACTF{"``` won't get you the flag actuallyðŸ˜‚. This is because the flag format actually changed (case-sesitive wise). So, running only the ```strings``` command on the binary gives you the flag

command:```strings robots.txt```

We got the flag

```
We have a "vmdk" image, well what I did was convert this to a raw image using qemu

To install qemu you can use the command ```sudo apt-get install qemu-utils```

To convert to raw image you can use the command ```qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O raw doh\ ctf.vmdk doh.raw```

Now that we are done converting we can mount this using autopsy
