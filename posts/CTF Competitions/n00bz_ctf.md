Checking the announcement channel on the discord server should get you the flag

We have this, so the task is to find the airline's hub (the airport where they mostly operate from). Use the three letter airport IATA code and wrap it in n00bz{}.

Doing a reverse image search

I didn't find anything interesting, so I just did this instead

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/598dae29-eae0-4f71-9f2b-bfa6595f4f77)

YupðŸ˜‚, So I found the airplane's hub to be ```Air Tahiti Nu```, the next thing now is to find the IATA code

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7dd7577-df87-4964-a549-9fd2ed75f50a)

That's the IATA code

## Disk Golf

Download the file to your machine and extract

I love disk challs hehe, this one was quite easy though (easier than sanity check heheðŸ’€)

For some unknown reasons I couldn't mount this using the mount command, so I used Autopsy instead

We've successfully mounted the disk image

Now, to get the flag just search for "flag.txt" (ezzzz right??)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f947ff03-7d4d-4316-8a40-82daaad6a58f)

Checking the content

This looks like Ascii Code, lets decode

## EVM - The Basics

The task is to find the value, in hex, that you need to send to make the contract STOP and not self destruct.

We were given a txt file, checking the contents of the file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cfc1d36-f7e0-4ff2-9083-81d41446e8ed)

This is an EVM ByteCode, so we can use an online bytecode decompiler to decompile

Lets use [this](https://ethervm.io/decompile)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c15e67c-57d1-4f19-ace4-1a07d50211fe)

This is a code snippet written in EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode. Specifically, it appears to be a smart contract written in a low-level, assembly-like language used for Ethereum smart contracts.

I actually can't read this so I had to look for another decompiler

I found [this](https://app.dedaub.com/decompile)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab01f220-570a-4263-88f6-b4334a6cc1ad)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73eaa1a1-4f2a-4fa4-9163-b0c798bd6618)

Finally, a code I can read

```sol
function function_selector() public payable { 
    assert(0xfdc29ff358a3 != 4919 * msg.value);
    selfdestruct(0);
}
```
Before I explain this, lets convert that hex value hehe

```sol
function function_selector() public payable { 
    assert(279012349008035 != 4919 * msg.value);
    selfdestruct(0);
}
```
Now I can explain what this piece of code does

```
1. Receives Ether: The function can accept Ether when called due to the payable keyword.
2. Assertion Check: It checks if the product of 4919 and the amount of Ether sent (msg.value) does not equal 279012349008035. If this condition is false, the transaction reverts.
3. Self-Destruct: If the assertion passes, the contract self-destructs and sends all its remaining Ether to the zero address (0), effectively burning the Ether.
```
Let me break it down further, the contract stops if
```
279012349008035 == 4919 * msg.value
```
This is more a maths issue lool, to get the ```msg.value``` we can just do this
```
msg.value == 279012349008035/4919
```
Lets get the value

Niceeee, lets convert that to hex using [this](https://www.dcode.fr/hexadecimal-system)

We found our flag alreadyðŸ˜Ž
