I participated in the cruXipher CTF, I joined late though (5hrs before it ended). I was in search of forensics chall and yeah I found some interesting ones here.

Upon downloading the file I got a file in the .docx format

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonðŸ’€bl4ck4non-sec)-[~/â€¦/CTF/cruxipher/forensics/objects_in_the_mirror]
â””â”€$ ls -la

When I opened the docx file with Libre Office I got this

Nothing out of the ordinary

Ever heard of `oletools`??

Well, that's what I used

Yup, that's it

You can install with pip `sudo -H pip install -U oletools`

I started out by using `oleid`

oleid is a script to analyze OLE files such as MS Office documents (e.g. Word, Excel), to detect specific characteristics usually found in malicious files (e.g. malware). For example it can detect VBA macros and embedded Flash objects.â€‹
