I participated in the cruXipher CTF, I joined late though (5hrs before it ended). I was in search of forensics chall and yeah I found some interesting ones here.

I solved 3 forensics challs, submitted 2 flags before the ctf ended, I just completed the last one now

Upon downloading the file I got a file in the .docx format

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonðŸ’€bl4ck4non-sec)-[~/â€¦/CTF/cruxipher/forensics/objects_in_the_mirror]
â””â”€$ ls -la           
total 84

```
When I opened the docx file with Libre Office I got this
