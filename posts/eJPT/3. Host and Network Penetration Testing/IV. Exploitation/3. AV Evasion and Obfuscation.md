Obfuscation has to do with changing the signature of the malware we are generating

Types of AV Detection Methods
1. Signature based  detection (This is a unique sequence of bytes that uniquely identifies malware )
2. Heuristic based detection (relies on rules or decision to determine whether a binary is malicious)
3. Behaviour based detection (relies on idenifying malware by monitoring its  behaviour)


Evasion Techniques
1. On-disk evasion technique
   a. obfuscation
   b. encoding
   c. packing
   d. crypters
2. In-memory evasion technique
