To understand pivoting, you need to understand portforwarding

>Port forwarding is the process of directing traffic from a specific port on a target system to a specific port on our system

So, to get access to the other  IP, add it to your route table after running 
```
ipconfig
```
To add the route, the IP we are adding to route is the victim 1's ip
```
run autoroute -s 10.0.29.0/20
```
To list active routes
```
run autoroute -p
```
Since the autoroute applies only in metasploit, the inbuilt portscanner module can be used
```
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set rhosts (Victim's 2 ip)
run
```
If there's an http or https port running, we can't view  it in our browser since the autoroute is only available in metasploit. So, what we can do is portforward 
```
portfwd add -l 1234 -p 80 -r 10.10.10.10

-l --> port you want to forward to
-p --> port you want to forward
-r --> ip address of victim 2
```
To view the webpage you can go to the  url
```
http://127.0.0.1:1234
```
or if you want to run a nmp scan
```
nmap -sV -p 1234 127.0.0.1
```
