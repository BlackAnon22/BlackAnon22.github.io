<h4>Upgrading non-interactive shells</h4>
```
/bin/bash -i
```
Another  thing to do is to list out the available shells on the system
```
cat /etc/shells
```
Also check the version of python is installed
```
which python
python --version
```

my favorite as usual :xD

```
python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
```

To set the user path variable
```
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```
This also works
```
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash
```
