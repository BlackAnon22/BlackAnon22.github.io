<h4>Clearing tracks on windows</h4>

>A good practice is to store all your scripts, exploits and binaries in the C:/Temp directory on windows  and the /tmp on linux

>Take note of where exploits and payloads you run are stored so they can be deleted afterwards

To run resource scripts on windows meterpreter
```
resource /path/to/file.rc
```

>Resource scripts can actually help with clearing uploaded packages and binaries, saves you the stress of removing them one by one

Another thing to do is clear event logs, meterpreter has a module that can do this
```
clearev
```




<h4>Clearing tracks on Linux</h4>

>Instead of deleting the  ".bash_history" file, you can just delete the commands you ran so it won't be obvious that someone messed it up

so to clear the history
```
history -c
```
If the commands are being stored in the ".bash_history" file, another thing that can be done is
```
cat /dev/null > .bash_history
history -c
```
so, this moves the content of the .bash_history file to the history file  which makes it easier to clear since we do not want to delete the .bash_history file
