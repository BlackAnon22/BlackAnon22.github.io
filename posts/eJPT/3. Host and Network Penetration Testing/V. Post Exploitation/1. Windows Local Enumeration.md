<h4>Enumerating system information</h4>

>Hotfixes you get from running the "systeminfo" command can be researched on. So, with this you'll know the vulnerability that is being patched  and also if the vulnerability still exists

To get hotfixes on windows, with their description and when it was installed
```
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixId,InstalledOn
```




<h4>Enumerating Users and Groups</h4>

To check for logged on users, a post exploitation module can be used. Backgrounding the previous session
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
set SESSION
run
```
Checking the available privileges on the command shell
```
whoami /priv (this is different from the command used for the meterpreter shell)
```
Checking the logged on users on the  command shell
```
query user
```
To learn more about a user
```
net user (username)
```
To enumerate all groups on the system
```
net localgroup
```



<h4>Enumerating Network Information</h4>

To check if the network was part of an internal network in the case of pivoting, running this  command will show the ethernet adapter information for the internal network from there we can go ahead to add the route 
```
ipconfig /all
```
To display the routing table
```
route print
```
To discover other devices on the network
```
arp -a
```
To display a list of open connections or the services that are currently running and the ports running on the target system
```
netstat -ano
```
To display the firewall state
```
netsh firewall show state
netsh advfirewall firewall show
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
```



<h4>Enumerating Processes and Services</h4>
To obtain a list of started services
```
net start
```
To obtain a list of running services
```
wmic service list brief
```
To get the list of processes running as well as the services running under a particular process
```
tasklist /SVC
```
To get a list of scheduled tasks running
```
schtasks /query /fo LIST
schtasks /query /fo /v (displays additional information)
```




<h4>Automating local windows enumeration</h4>

>A tool called JAWS (Just Another Windows (Enum) Script).  It can be gotten from this [link](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS)

To show mounted drives available on the target system
```
show_mount
```
Automating the  available privileges  for a user
```
use  post/windows/gather/win_privs
set SESSIOn
run
```
To check if it is a virtual machine
```
use post/windows/gather/checkvm
```
To enumerate for applications installed on the  target's machine
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_applications
```
Enumerating for computers connected  to the target's device
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_computers
```
To get a list of installed patches
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_patches
```
To enumerate for shares
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_shares
```
