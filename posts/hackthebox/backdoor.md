oops, we found no plugins. We found a username but trust me getting the password isn't possible lool.

While enumerating I found something in the ```/wp-content/plugins``` directory. Lets navigate there

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/223008583-8bb171b5-f45c-4fa5-8937-7859b2c83aad.png)

Reading the _readme.txt_ file I found a plugin ```Ebook 1.1```. Checking for available exploits I found one

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/223009432-743be987-3cf6-4b59-a472-e93045e886a7.png)

As we can see that version is vulnerable to directory transversal. Lets go ahead and exploit this vulnerability




# Exploitation

Link to Exploit:https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39575

Reading the Poc of this exploi, I found this

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67879936/223010517-754e631c-4d40-4d41-9258-100209fc30a1.png)

so we'll navigate to that directory to confirm if we can read the ```wp-config.php``` file.

Link:http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../wp-config.php

Going to that link should download the ```wp_config.php``` file to your machine
