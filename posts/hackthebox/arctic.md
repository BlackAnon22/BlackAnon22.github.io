From our scan we have 3 open ports, we have a port 8500 that runs the http service. Our enumeration today will be focused on that port.



# Enumeration (Port 8500)

Navigate to the webpage

Checking the directories, I found this login page

From the above screenshot we can see that ```Adobe ColdFusion``` is being used on this webpage

Lets try using default passwords for the login page

oops, doesn't workðŸ¥²

Well, I found an exploit for this

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/dac6ffd1-8704-45a4-8091-9f766a84137a)

So, it is vulnerabale to ```CVE-2010-2861```. You can get it [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14641) 

Reading the exploit, I found this

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/7f0ea944-f3f0-4d95-90d6-999e9bd2b7b8)

This means we can exploit this webpage using directory transversal. Well, this is not a Linux box, I would have said we should try reading the ```/etc/passwd``` fileðŸ˜‚. 

After a little research, I found out that ColdFusion 8 passwords are typically stored in an encrypted format in a configuration file called ```password.properties```. This file is used to store various ColdFusion passwords, including the administrator password and datasources passwords. The full path is typically ```[ColdFusion Installation Directory]/lib/password.properties```.

So we'll try to read the ```password.properties``` by navigating to the url ```?locale=../../../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties%00en```
