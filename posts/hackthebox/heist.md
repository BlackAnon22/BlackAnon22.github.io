From our nmap scan we have quite a number of ports opened. We'll start our enumeration today from port 80



# Enumeration (Port 80)

We get this login page. Since we don't have any creds lets login as guest

Nice, this is a conversation between user ```Hazard``` and the ```admin```. 

Lets check out the configuration file user ```Hazard``` sent.

From the above screenshot we can see encrypted passwords for users ```Hazard```, ```rout3r``` and ```admin```.

Lets try to crack the first password

We got the password to be ```stealth1agent```. Lets try gain access using winrm

command:```evil-winrm -u hazard -i 10.129.96.157 -p 'stealth1agent' -S```
