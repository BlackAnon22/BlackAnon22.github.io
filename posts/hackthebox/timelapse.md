From our nmap scan we have quite a number of open ports. Our enumeration today will actually be focused on the port running the smb service, that is, port 445, also the port running the http service, that is, port 5986.




# Enumeration (Port 445)

Lets start out by checking the shares available on the smb server

command:```smbclient -L 10.129.227.105```

Since we have no password just hit the ```Enter``` key

```

```
We have 6 shares available on this server. The most interesting one out of these shares is the sharename ```Shares```

Lets connect to this sharename to see what we have there

command:```smbclient //10.129.227.105/Shares```

Since we have no password just hit the ```Enter``` key

```

Cool, we can now view the files avaiable on the sharename ```Shares``` on the smb server.

Navigating to the ```Dev``` directory, there's a zip file

Lets download this file to our machine by using the ```get``` command.

command:```get winrm_backup.zip```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/80b5ad2e-52d3-4328-8b34-2a5e76bfeee4)

Good. Now we can try to unzip the file

A password is required but we don't have one. 

Well, I called john already and he said he will be sending one of his brothers, ```zip2ohn```.

Using ```zip2john``` we'll try to generate a hash that can be cracked with ```john```

command:```zip2john winrm_backup.zip > winrm.txt```

command:```john winrm.txt  --wordlist=/home/bl4ck4non/Documents/rockyou.txt```

```

So we got the password to be ```supremelegacy```. Now lets unzip

cool the password worked and we got a ```PKCS#12``` file.

For those who don't know about ```PKCS#12``` file, it is a cryptographic file format that typically contains both a digital certificate and its associated private key. These files are often used for securing sensitive information and establishing secure connections, such as in SSL/TLS certificates for web servers.

To access this file we can use the ```openssl``` command

command:```openssl pkcs12 -info -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/90cff726-3689-4bb6-afa9-d3519ba43540)

oops, a password is required. 

I called  john again but he wasn't picking his calls (he probably thinks I'm disturbing him lool). So, I called one of his brothers ```pfx2john```

Using ```pfx2john``` to get the hash and then using john to crack the hash

command:```pfx2john legacyy_dev_auth.pfx > legacyy.txt```

command:```john legacyy.txt  --wordlist=/home/bl4ck4non/Documents/rockyou.txt```

```

If you recall, when we ran the nmap command we saw this port opened.

<font color="Green">Port 5986 is commonly used for secure communications with Windows Remote Management (WinRM) over HTTPS. WinRM is a management protocol used for remote management and automation tasks in Windows environments.
</font>

So, we'll be using the evil-winrm tool since we have a private key and a certificate

command:```evil-winrm -i 10.129.227.105 -c certificate.cert -k private.pem -S```

We got a user shell as user ```legacyy```😎. Lets go ahead and escalate our privileges
