From the above scan, we have only 1 open port and that's the port that runs the http service. This means our enumeration today will be focused on port 80



# Enumeration

Navigate to the webpage

This webpage is being hosted by ```HttpFileServer```. 

I think there's an exploit for this version of ```HttpFileServer```, well lets check

Well there isðŸ˜…. Lets exploit right away



# Exploitation

Well, I found this great exploit, you can download it [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161)

So, we'll set the ```LHOST``` to our tun0 ip, we'll also set the ```LPORT``` to the port we plan on listening on

Save the script.

Ensure you have your netcat listener ready before running the script

Running the script requires the target's ip and port

command:```python2 39161.py 10.129.58.117 80```

Checking our netcat listener,

We got a user shellðŸ™‚. Lets go ahead and escalate our privileges.
